	description = After successful negotiations with REPOSoftTech, Sphero-Hendron Engineering Dynamics built a self contained refrigeratorfor storing all the office drinks in. The boffins even stuck in an RTG so that when the power was out the drinks steyed cool! Inadvertantly one of the mail guys got stuck inside and no one noticed for a week. - WARRANTY VOID IF USED BELOW ROOM TEMPERATURE -
